# VMC-CSC Challenge #3

Write a program that takes in a list of integers and returns the two indices of the numbers that add up to a specified target. The program should:

* Prompt the user to enter a list of integers, separated by spaces.
* Prompt the user to enter the target sum.
* Find the two indices of the numbers in the list that add up to the target sum.
* Print out the two indices.

Here are some additional details:

* The list of integers should be input as a single string, with each integer separated by a space.
* The program should assume that the list contains at least two integers.
* If there are multiple pairs of indices that add up to the target sum, the program should return any one of those pairs.

Here's an example of what your program might look like in action:

```
Enter the list of integers: 1 5 7 9 13 4
Enter the target sum: 10
Indices of the two numbers that add up to the target sum: 0 3
```

Good luck, and happy coding!
