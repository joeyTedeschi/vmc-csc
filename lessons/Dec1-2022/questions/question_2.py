# Let's ask the user to enter any word/sentence they'd like
# If the string is a palindrome, we'll print a message tell them that
# If it isn't, we should print a message saying it is not a palindrome

# ðŸ™‹ A palindrome is a word that is spelled the same forwards and backwards, example: "eye", or "wow"

# ðŸ™‹ How can we use one of the loops we've seen to reverse a string?
