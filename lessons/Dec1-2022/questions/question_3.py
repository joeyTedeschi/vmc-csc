# Let's make mad libs!
# Mad libs is a game where a user is told to enter a couple of words and numbers (for example: "Enter an adjective", "Enter a noun", "Enter a number greater than 100")
# These values are stored and then added to a story the user doesn't have access to
# The result is a story where parts of it don't really make sense... because the user didn't actually know what was coming!

# 📝 Ask the user to enter a noun, an integer, a place, and an adjective
# 📝 If the user does not enter a number when you ask them to, keep asking them to until they do
# 📝 Add these values to the story you wrote and print it for the user! Have fun with it!
