# Write 2 python functions
# The first function should accept a single number, and return the result of doubling, and then taking the square root of it
# The second should accept a range of numbers, and return a random value from it

# Let the user enter 2 numbers. Tell the user that they can type "skip" for the second number if they'd like to.
# You can assume the user will only enter a number for the first value, and only a number or the word skip
# If the user entered 1 number, call the first function and print the result
# If the user entered 2 numbers, call the second function and return a random number between the two (if it's the same number, just print that number)

# ðŸ™‹ This can be made easier by using some modules that already exist in python (check out `math` and `random`)
