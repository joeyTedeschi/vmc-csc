# Let's now combine everything we've seen today
# We'll create a program that will be able to tell us whether a number is even or odd!

# 📝 Create a variable that stores any number you'd like

# 📝 If the number is not equal to 0, let's print out "This isn't 0!"

# 📝 Let's check if the number is even or odd, and print out the result

# 🙋 Are there any edge cases we should consider?
