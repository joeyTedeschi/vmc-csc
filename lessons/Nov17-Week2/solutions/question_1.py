# Let's make sure we have a grasp of some of the main blocks we'll be using in these exercises
# Let's create a variable with a meaningful name, store your name in it,
# and then print it out with a message

# 📝 Create your variable
name = 'Joey'

# 📝 Print our variable concatenated (linked together) with another message
print('Hi, my name is ' + name)
